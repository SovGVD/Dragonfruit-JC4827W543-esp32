# Third-party notices

`src/components/display/nv3041a.c` uses the NV3041A register settings and QSPI
protocol from Moon On Our Nation's [Arduino_GFX](https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFX),
version 1.4.9, the display library used by the local `esp32-pipboy` reference.
The driver itself is native C for ESP-IDF and does not link Arduino_GFX.

## MAME

The Cybiko Xtreme emulation (`src/components/h8s` and `src/components/cybiko`)
is original C, but it would not exist without [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/)
and the people who worked out this hardware there. Its hardware description
follows:

- the Cybiko driver (`src/mame/cybiko`), the HD66421 LCD controller and the
  PCF8593 clock, by Tim Schuerewegen;
- the imgtool `cybikoxt` module (`src/tools/imgtool/modules/cybikoxt.cpp`),
  by Tim Schuerewegen: the RAM disk page layout and page checksum in
  `cy_disk.c`;
- the H8 instruction table and on-chip peripheral models (`src/devices/cpu/h8`),
  by Olivier Galibert and hap; `tools/h8s-diff/patterns.h` is generated from
  its `h8.lst`;
- the Intel/AMD flash model, by Aaron Giles;
- for the Cybiko Classic, the `cybikov1` machine, the H8S/2245 family
  (`h8s2245`) and the AT45DBxx DataFlash (`at45dbxx`), by Tim Schuerewegen,
  Olivier Galibert and hap.

## ReBiko

The Cybiko Classic emulation (`cy_classic.c` and the `m->classic` parts of
`src/components/cybiko`) follows Dan Berkowitz's
[ReBiko](https://github.com/RetroCodeRamen/rebiko), a Cybiko Classic and
Xtreme emulator for the LilyGO T-Deck and the desktop. ReBiko worked out the
Classic's memory map, the AT45 DataFlash on SCI1, the radio co-processor's
Classic framing, the battery values CyOS 1.2.46 wants, the empty-block format
of the flash (`cybiko_at45_format_free`), the idea of emulating a 1 MB
AT45DB081 for more room, and where CyOS 1.2.46 keeps the Cybiko ID in RAM.
Dragonfruit's code is written separately, but those details come from
ReBiko, under the MIT license:
